One line of his studies examines ways of improving students' learning outcomes. This has included demonstrating how students can learn better by active learning, understanding why disucssing (or interaction) is an effective instructional method from the students' perspective, and more recently, he has investigated a method of effective learning, by having small groups of students discuss collaboratively with a peer.
